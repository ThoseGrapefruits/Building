#Building
> A virtual 2D building simulation and modelling program with random "people" who interact with various things in the building, such as elevators, lights, doors, etc.

<br><hr><br>

##Notes
- I would have used OpenGL, but JOGL is weird and since the rendering will be 2D and very simple, I'm just using `java.awt.Graphics2D` to render.
- Some objects (like doors and elevators) can be directly interacted with in order to use/activate them, but others will require special methods of activation (like light switches for lights).

##Class & Function Outline
###`Building`
> Contains the main function and serves as the "controller" in MVC.

<br>
###`View`
> JFrame window

####`contentPane`
> Content pane area on which everything will be drawn.

####`View()`
> Initializes a new `JPanel` window.

<br>
###`Surface`
> `JPanel` 2D rendering panel.

####`paintComponent(Graphics g)`
> Performs all of the drawing.

- Creates a `Graphics2D` object to be used for rendering and passes it to various drawing functions which draw the specific object types.

<br>
###`Light`
> Supplies light to a room.

- Activated only through a `LightSwitch`.
- Will probably have an `emittedLight` property that gives the corner coordinates of the area the light fills, or just a `lightStrength` property that indicates the maximum distance the light can travel.

<br>
###`LightSwitch`
> Activates a light linked to it.

- `Person` will seek this out if there is no light.
- Is linked to a `LightSwitch` on instantiation and will send a signal to that `Light` on activation.

<br>

###`Door`
> Entrance that can be opened or closed.

<br>
###`Person`
> Virtual person that automatically pathfinds and interacts with objects that can be interacted with.

- Seek out a `LightSwitch` if a room is dark.
- Opens and closes `Door`s

##MVC Outline
###Model
- `Building`
- `Elevator`
- `Door`
- `Light`
	- `LightSwitch`
- `Person`

###View
- `View`
- `Surface`

###Controller
- `Building`

##Plan
1. Build `Test` class and continuously test the system throughout.
2. Complete model classes, keeping in mind the bigger picture and making sure it will be easy to make visuals with them later.
	1. `Elevator`
	2. `Door`
	3. `Light` & `LightSwitch`
	4. `Building`
	5. `Person`
		1. Some sort of interaction detection system
		2. Random movement & path-finding system
3. Create view classes to visualize the models.
	1. `View` âœ“
	2. `Surface`
4. Build controller to get everything going.

##Brainstorming
- How should I implement walls & other permanent impassable objects?
- Coordinate system? Definitely need this in one way or another. I guess I could just stick to pixels, as I would otherwise just have a scaled-up equivalent of a per-pixel coordinate system.
